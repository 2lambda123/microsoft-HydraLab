## What is Hydra Lab and what can it do?

<span id="what-is"></span>

Hydra Lab is a framework that can help you easily build an intelligent cloud testing platform utilizing the devices in hand.

Hydra Lab enables dev team to quickly build a self-manageable and intelligent cloud testing infrastructure. With the help of Hydra Lab, you can:

- Either: Build a new cloud testing network with Hydra Lab released packages.
- Or: Onboard your test device to an existing network with low-cost and small effort.
