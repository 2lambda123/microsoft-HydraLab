# Welcome to Hydra Lab Pages

The Hydra Lab is the open-source mobile app cloud testing framework that we built from scratch since mid 2021 to empower every dev team to easily set up a cloud testing infrastructure utilizing the devices in hand. With the help of Hydra Lab, you can:
- Either: Build a new cloud testing network with Hydra Lab released packages.
- Or: Onboard your test device to an existing network with low-cost and small effort.

Hydra Lab now support automated test cases based on Appium(Java) for Android/iOS/Windows/Web(Browser), or Android Espresso.
